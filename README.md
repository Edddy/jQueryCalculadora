jQueryCalculadora
=================

A simple plugin for doing simple inline calculation inside any &lt;input>

Always loved to make simple calculations inside any number textbox on MS Money, now you can do it with jQuery also. I skipped showing the calculator, because it will create big trouble maintaining the focus in the input, but show a nice ticket with the past operations.

This is my first jQuery plugin and first GitHub project, so have mercy :)
